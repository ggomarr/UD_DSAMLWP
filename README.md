# Udemy Data Science and Machine Learning with Python Jupyter notebooks

Thеsе notebooks contain the code used to follow the Data Science and Machine Learning with Python course offered by Udemy (as of 2017-03-30).

Additional files would be needed to make all of them work:
- A copy of the movielens 100k dataset
- Classified ham and spam emails
- Misc files containing data on:
  - Past hires
  - Wikipedia pages
  - Linearly correlated points

These were too large to be added to the repository.
